Network Benchmark:1) Login to two compute nodes and download the MyNETBench.c (in server code) on one compute node and MyNETBench.c (Client code) on another computer node.2) Using ifcongif obtain the ipaddress for the server node and use that address to connect to the server from the client.3) Compile the codes on the respective nodes to generate the binary files using below          gcc -Wall -o MyNETBench MyNETBench.c -lpthread	   4) Run the below commands in parallel for each test case    (e.g) For 1 thread 1kb tcp connection run the server and client as 	    ./MyNETBench 1 1kb T S on server node	    ./MyNETBench 1 1kb T C on client node			    format: ./MyNETBench thread-count block_size protocol mode	    where thread_count [1,2,4,8]		  block_size [1KB, 32KB, 1byte]		  protocol [T/C] for TCP and UDP respectively		  mode [S/C] for Server and Client respectively		5) Run for all the test cases below (test cases provided)6) The output will be displayed on the client node after the execution is completed. For the purpose of this experiment I took output for each test case into an output file on the client node using below command.	     ./MyNETBench thread-count block_size protocol C > network-TCP-1KB-1thread.out.dat
